## Selected Design Approach: Warm Minimalism with Organic Flow

I've selected **Response 1: Warm Minimalism with Organic Flow** as the design philosophy for GIST 2025.

### Why This Approach?

This design resonates most authentically with GIST's core mission: creating intentional spaces for meaningful conversation. The warm, organic aesthetic mirrors the human-centered nature of the event, while the minimalist framework ensures the focus remains on the community and the experience itself.

The terracotta and forest green palette connects to African heritage while feeling contemporary and inviting. The organic layout and curved elements reflect the natural flow of conversation, and the generous whitespace emphasizes intentionality—a core value of GIST.

### Design Implementation Guidelines

- **Typography**: Playfair Display for headings (elegant, intentional), Inter for body (readable, modern)
- **Color Palette**: Terracotta (#D97757), Forest Green (#2D5016), Cream (#F5F1E8), Off-white (#FAFAF8)
- **Layout**: Asymmetric, card-based with organic wave dividers
- **Imagery**: Organic, irregular frames for event photos
- **Interactions**: Smooth, natural animations that feel human-centered
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace emphasizing intentionality and breathing room

This approach will create a website that feels warm, intentional, and authentically connected to GIST's mission of bringing together high-quality people for meaningful conversations.
